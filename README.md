#To Do List (Ruby Version)

##About
This project was completed by Katharine Chen and Mark Rubenstein for Epicodus (Week#5 Day #1).

##Description
This project is to create a simple interactive todolist in Ruby in the terminal. 

##Functionality
* User can mark a task as done and have it removed from their list.
* Users can have multiple lists. You should have two models now: Task and List; each should go in its own file.
